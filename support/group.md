# Group Setting

`Grouping` is a means of managing a large number of snippets, one of which has multiple snippets, and another file that can hold multiple snippets that collectively relate to the same snippet description.

If the `current grouping configuration` is not enabled, the `ALL grouping configuration` is used by default, and the correct configuration can be run in different projects using the same instructions.
