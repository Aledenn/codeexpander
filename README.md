# Oncework

Oncework is an efficiency class software that combines github-gist with TextExpander class software to implement TextExpander class software that is centered on Gist. In short, it is a quick input tool for Mac/Win. It can save Content that needs to be typed repeatedly, and it can preset an Abbreviation, which will be automatically expanded the next time you need it.
